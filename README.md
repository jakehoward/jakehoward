## Employment History

### TES Global - March 2016 to present

I currently work as a Senior Engineer on the Data Science team. My primary technical responsibility is enabling data scientists to add value by creating tooling and infrastructure that allows them to go from idea to integrated product quickly. I also help the team create iterative delivery plans by using a range of techniques to understand the value chain and organise work.
