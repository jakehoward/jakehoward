If you’re interested in working with me, please contact me via [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/jake-h-a4ab0138)

I like to approach work by starting with the value proposition and working backwards from there. I first work with a business to identify what value is and how to add value to their organisation. Using that as a goal, ideally with measurements in place, I create an iterative development roadmap to achieve that goal with constant tight feedback loops to assess progress and make course corrections. I’ve successfully applied this approach over short and long timescales to: customer facing products, internal tools, data analytics systems and machine learning products.

I highly value: simplicity; organising teams such that they’re coherent, with minimal communication overhead; growing my own and others skills; and doing work that adds value to the customer or organisation (or both).

I don’t believe the choice of programming language matters as much as how it’s used, but I have professional experience with NodeJS, Python, Scala and C++. At the moment, I do most of my personal projects in Clojure. I also have lesser experience in many other languages.

If I sound like a good fit for your organisation, I would love to hear from you.
